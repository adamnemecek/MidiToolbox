MidiToolbox
===========

Some useful MIDI classes from the OS X AudioToolbox:

MusicSequence
MusicTrack
MusicPlayer
MusicEventIterator

wrapped in Swift, and added to an Xcode example project for OS X.

Next steps: 
-- reconfigure into native frameworks for OS X and iOS

-- establish a higher-order functional API layer and mini DSL to make event creation, transformation, dispatch, reflection as easy as changing the order of some words around along a message chain.
