MidiToolbox
===========

Some useful MIDI classes from the OS X AudioToolbox:

MusicSequence
MusicTrack
MusicPlayer
MusicEventIterator

wrapped in Swift, and bundled together into an OS X Cocoa Framework.

Next steps: establish a higher-order functional API layer and/or mini DSL to make event creation, transformation, dispatch, reflection as easy as changing the order of some words around along a message chain.
